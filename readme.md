[**remark**][remark] plugin to remove all links, references, and
definitions.
Similar to [remark-unlink](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-unlink) but
allows images.

Original motivation was to process Markdown documents in a way that would make
it easier to read as a plain text.
On an ebook reader or a piece of paper the links are useless and look ugly.

## Install

[npm][]:

```sh
npm install remark-remove-links
```

## Use

Say we have the following file, `example.md`.
Imagine section titles and URLs a bit longer though.

```markdown
## TOC

- [section 1](#section-1)
- [section 2](#section-2)

## section 1

Section [content][1] may include some [links](https://domain.name/path).

[1]: https://domain.name/path

## section 2

![some images are here also](https://gif.com/1.gif)

More content.
```

And our script, `example.js`, looks as follows:

```js
var vfile = require('to-vfile')
var remark = require('remark')
var removeLinks = require('remark-remove-links')

remark()
  .use(removeLinks)
  .process(vfile.readSync('example.md'), function(err, file) {
    if (err) throw err
    console.log(String(file))
  })
```

Now, running `node example` yields:

```markdown
## TOC

- section 1
- section 2

## section 1

Section content may include some links.

## section 2

![some images are here also](https://gif.com/1.gif)

More content.
```

## API

#### `remark().use(removeLinks)`

Plugin to remove all links, references, and definitions.

## Security

Use of `remark-remove-links` does not involve [**rehype**][rehype]
([**hast**][hast])or user content so there are no openings for
[cross-site scripting (XSS)][xss] attacks.
